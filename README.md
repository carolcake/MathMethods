This program prompts the user to enter an angle in degrees and will display it
in radians and take the sine of that angle. Then, it will prompt the user to 
enter a different positive integer to take the square root of it. Next, it 
will prompt the user to enter 2 integers and display the power. After, it will
take the floor and ceiling of a decimal number entered and display it. Finally,
it will prompt the user for a lower and upper bound and it will display a 
random number between the lower and upper bound and display it.
